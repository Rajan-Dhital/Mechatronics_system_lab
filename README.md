# Mechatronics_system_lab
The manipulator robot consists of three motors to drive the entire arm. The motor A controls the gripper, motor B controls link three and motor C is in charge of rotation of the entire arm. All the motors are coupled with gear box. For motor B, the gear ratio is 40:8 and for the motor C it is 36:12. In addition with motors, manipulator is also equipped with two touch sensors and three encoders for each motor. The touch sensor 1 limits the up and down motion of arm and the touch 3 limits the rotation of entire arm. Encoders of each motor can be used to read rotation of specific motor. The main aim of this lab is to develop a picking, placing and homing behavior of the robotic arm.
